        <h3>About The Band</h3><br>
            <p> The Rockers combines noise rock and grunge as one of the more spastic all female bands that surfaced in the late 1980s and early 1990s out of Minneapolis, Minn. The group stuck out for lead vocalist and guitarist Kat Bjelland's contrasting doll appearance and aggressive lyrics and singing. </p><p>The Rockers gained more traction in the underground scene, although shared similarities to other bands in the "riot grrrl" movement. Their debut full-length album "Spanking Machine" released in 1991 received critical acclaim on independent charts, although their hit single "Bruise Violet" on the follow up album is said to criticize Courtney Love</p>
