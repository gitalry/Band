            <p>The Rockers gained more traction in the underground scene, although shared similarities to other bands in the "riot grrrl" movement. Their debut full-length album "Spanking Machine" released in 1991 received critical acclaim on independent charts, although their hit single "Bruise Violet" on the follow up album is said to criticize Courtney Love</p>
